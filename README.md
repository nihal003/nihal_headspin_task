### 1. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 4 or 5, we get 4, 5, and 8. The sum of these multiples is 17. Then find the sum of all the multiples of 4 or 5 below 1000.

### 2. 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
